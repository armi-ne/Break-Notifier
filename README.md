# Break-Notifier

Simple script I made that notifies the user (both with a sound notification and a Windows 10 Toast notification) of when to take a break from looking at the screen.
Initially the idea came from a trip to the opticians where I was informed that people are advised to take a 20 second break every 20 minutes when dealing with computer screens for a long time, thought this would be a fun and quick way for me to put that into practice and make a mini simple project out of it.
